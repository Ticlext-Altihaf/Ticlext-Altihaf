# What

I'm Althaf, a self proclaimed millionare (in local currency) tech lead from Jakarta, Indonesia.

That means I solve problems that no one solved yet, not problem like "What is beauty?" because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy.

I can do most of popular programming language e.g Javascript, Python, Java, C#, Rust, PHP, etc.

I like strongly typed language like C# and Rust, my strongest dislike is Javascript (I can't escape this).

I describe myself with this image:
